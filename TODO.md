This is my TODO list for ggwm. Items are not in any particular order.

[] Simplify the building system, may be remove configure and autotools;    
[] Hopefully fix the bug that for some font configurations, the text on some elements is not drawn;    
[] Clean the code in schrift_x11 and add functions to compare and to clone fonts;    
[] Work on rendering "SFT" text without the need of libXrender;    
[] Test the possibility of partly replacing the lex/parser with the one available in nanosvg;
