This is my TODO list for ggwm. Items are not in any particular order.

- [ ] Replace all the refences to jwm/JWM with ggwm/GGWM;
- [ ] Simplify the building system, may be remove configure and autotools;    
- [ ] Hopefully fix the bug that for some font configurations, the text on some elements is not drawn;    
- [ ] Clean the code in schrift_x11 and add functions to compare and to clone fonts;    
- [ ] Work on rendering "SFT" text without the need of libXrender;    
- [ ] Test the possibility of partly replacing the lex/parser with the one available in nanosvg;     
- [x] Try to avoid the need of libXpm for pixmaps;
- [ ] Investigate on the possible use of libgrapheme, in particular for RTL text.
- [ ] Release version 0.2.0;
- [ ] Separate components (wm, tray, clock, menu etc.)
